3*.Future tasks = do some plan and try add new functional to the newpost(if you will have free time)

	- use exceptions
	- use advanced filters for tickets (by name, by address, by price, by ownerName)
	- fill up our db by test data
	- save db to a file
	- load db from a file
	
	Think about 
		DirectorController
			control money account 
			pay salary
			pay tax
			get reports (each employee will make report(all actions of employee(use logs)))
			some actions with employees
				add
				remove
				find
				filter
				showInfo			

		AdminController
			some actions with employees
				add
				remove
				find
				filter
				showInfo
			show logs
			logs search
